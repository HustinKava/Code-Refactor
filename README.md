<h2>Description</h2>

This webpage is intended for a marketing company named SEO that targets search engine optimization, social media management and brand awareness.

<h2>My Experience</h2>

This was my first homework assignment and I am proud of my work. Although the html and CSS files were provided along with the images, I had to pay close attention to detail and see how I could make the code cleaner. I also noticed some changes that I needed to make in the code by removing tags and also adding tags. By doing this assignment I have become more familiar with VS Code, Git Bash, GitHub, html code and CSS properties. I now feel more comfortable using Git Bash and no longer need to look at my notes in order to commit and push changes across to GitHub. I ran into a pull request conflict which I was able to resolve fairly quickly and now know how to handle that situation. 

<h2>Change List</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
    The <b>search engine optimization</b> button on the navigation bar was not functioning correctly. I provided it with an id so that the page would scroll to the appropriate section when "search engine optimization" was pressed.
    </li>
    <li>
    Simplified the <b>search-engine-optimization</b>, <b>online-reputation-management</b> and <b>social-media-marketing</b> classes by grouping them together. I was able to remove 6 lines of code from the CSS style sheet without changing the appearance or functionality of the website.
    </li> 
    <li>
    Simplified the <b>benefit-lead</b>, <b>benefit-brand</b> and <b>benefit-cost</b> classes by grouping them together. I was able to remove 6 lines of code from the CSS style sheet without changing the appearance or functionality of the website.
    </li> 
    <li>
    Removed the <b>header</b> class and changed it to just <b>header</b> in CSS style sheet. Changed the <b>div</b> tags to header tags to follow sematic html5.
    </li>
    <li>
    Removed the <b>footer</b> class and changed it to just <b>footer</b> in CSS style sheet. changed the <b>div</b> tags to footer tags.
    </li>
    <li>
    Added <b>navigation</b> tags, replacing <b>div</b> tags inside the <b>header</b> to follow correct html5 sematic tags. Also adjusted the CSS style sheet to reflect the change.
    </li>
    <li>
    Changed the class name of <b>hero</b> to <b>background-image</b> so it is easier to follow and understand what the code is used for.
    </li>
    <li>
    Changed the <b>div</b> tags to section tags for the content with a class of <b>content</b> and <b>benefits</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
    Changed the website <b>title</b> to <b>marketing services</b> because I think it better describes the webpage.
    </li>
    <li>
    Provided easy to follow <b>comments</b> outlining what the html tags essentially do.
    </li>
    <li>
    Changed the <b>div</b> tags to <b>article</b> tags to follow html5 sematic tags that are within both <b>section</b> tags.
    </li>
    <li>
    Removed the <b></img></b> tag from the <b>cost-management</b> image code because the image tag is self closing and does not need <b></img></b>
    </li>
    <li>
    Added <b>alt text</b> for each image describing each picture to meet accessibility standards.
    </li>
    <li>
    Changed the order of the <b>CSS sheet</b> so it reflects styling from top to bottom of the webpage.
    </li>
</ul>
