Description

This was my first homework assignment and I am proud of my work. Although the html and CSS files were provided along with images I had to pay close attention to detail and see how I could make the code cleaner. I also noticed some changes that I needed to make in the code. 

<ul>
    <li>
    The "search engine optimization" button on the navigation bar was not functioning correctly. I provided it with an id so that the page would scroll to the appropriate section when pressed.
    </li>  
</ul>
